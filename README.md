# plot-sysbench
Run and generate graphs for Sysbench + MySQL. Plots throughput, CPU events, power consumption, and CPU usage. 

Results from testing with Dynimizer on Kaby Lake, Broadwell, and Ivy Bridge based CPU systems can be found in the results directory. The output.log files in each subdirectory directory contain a trace of all the commands executed when generating the results in that directory.

Tests are run and results generated by running ./plotSysbench.sh
